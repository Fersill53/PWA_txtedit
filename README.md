# PWA_txtedit
Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Description
This app is a text editor app that runs off of the browser and also works in offline mode as well. This is an app that was based off of J.A.T.E based off PWA. This app helped to solidify the use of concurrent servers, offline use, and access to web apps.
